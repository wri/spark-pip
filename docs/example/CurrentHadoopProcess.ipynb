    "# Current GFW Hadoop process\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will examine sample inputs and outputs of our current hadoop process. It will focus on calculating the area of tree cover loss within the footprint of a [single 10 degree by 10 degree tile](http://geojson.io/#data=data:application/json,%7B%22bbox%22%3A%5B-60%2C-10%2C-50%2C0%5D%2C%22features%22%3A%5B%7B%22bbox%22%3A%5B-60%2C-10%2C-50%2C0%5D%2C%22geometry%22%3A%7B%22coordinates%22%3A%5B%5B%5B-60%2C-10%5D%2C%5B-50%2C-10%5D%2C%5B-50%2C0%5D%2C%5B-60%2C0%5D%2C%5B-60%2C-10%5D%5D%5D%2C%22type%22%3A%22Polygon%22%7D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%22filename%22%3A%22loss.tif%22%2C%22id%22%3A%220%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22loss.tif%22%7D%2C%22type%22%3A%22Feature%22%7D%5D%2C%22type%22%3A%22FeatureCollection%22%7D).\n",

    "Results are summarized by polyname (intact forest landscapes, world database of protected areas (WDPA), etc) and by the iso/adm1/adm2 codes. For our analysis, we'll focus only on the iso/adm1/adm2 areas contained entirely within our 10x10 area. These boundaries are in geometry/gadm36_aoi.geojson.\n",

    "### Raster inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster inputs are from the [UMD Global Forest Change dataset](https://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest/download_v1.5.html). Our loss raster is available [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/earthenginepartners-hansen/GFC-2017-v1.5/Hansen_GFC-2017-v1.5_lossyear_00N_060W.tif). It has values of 2001 - 2017 if tree cover loss occurred in any of those years. Our tree cover canopy density raster is available [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/earthenginepartners-hansen/GFC-2017-v1.5/Hansen_GFC-2017-v1.5_treecover2000_00N_060W.tif), and represents the tree cover canopy density in the year 2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our process \"joins\" these two rasters, so that we're reporting the total area for each combination of tree cover loss and tree cover canopy density. This is currently stored in vector format as a TSV, but from a raster standpoint, this might be handled by stacking loss and tree cover density rasters as separate bands. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Polygon inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Polygons are input coverages for various areas of interest, intersected with our GADM admin boundary dataset. Example geometries for this analysis are in the `geometry/` folder. In addition to iso/adm1/adm2 information, each has `bound` fields for any dataset specific information we'd like to group by. Datasets in this example don't have any of these values, but a good example is our plantations data which includes the species and the age of each plantation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our raster and polygon layers are intersected, we group and sum the output table to derive our summary statistics."

We handle this postprocessing in pandas after the hadoop output runs."
